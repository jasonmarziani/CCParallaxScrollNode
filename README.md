# CCParallaxScrollNode for cocos2d-x

This project provides infinite Parallax Scrolling for a Cocos2d-X project. 

This code is 100% based on the [CCParallaxScrollingNode](https://github.com/aramkocharyan/cocos2d) project for cocos2d-iphone. (We even used the assets!) For more info on the original project check out the [write-up](http://ak.net84.net/iphone/creating-a-repeating-backgroundinfinite-parallax-effect-in-cocos2d/)
